# Project Introduction
* **Overview** 

UserBehavior is a dataset offered by Alibaba, containing user behavior records from Taobao. It serves as a valuable resource for researching implicit feedback recommendation problems. The dataset spans from November 25, 2017, to December 3, 2017, and includes 1,001,506 behavior samples from approximately 987,994 distinct users, 4,162,024 unique products, and 3,623 different product categories. The behaviors captured include clicks, purchases, additions to cart.

For my analysis using Python and Power BI, this dataset will provide valuable insights into user interactions within the Taobao platform.  🚀🔍
