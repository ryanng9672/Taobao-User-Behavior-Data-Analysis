# Project_Introduction
* **Overview** 

UserBehavior is a dataset offered by Alibaba, containing user behavior records from Taobao. It serves as a valuable resource for researching implicit feedback recommendation problems. The dataset spans from November 25, 2017, to December 3, 2017, and includes 1,001,506 behavior samples from approximately 987,994 distinct users, 4,162,024 unique products, and 3,623 different product categories. The behaviors captured include clicks, purchases, additions to cart.

For my analysis using Python and Power BI, this dataset will provide valuable insights into user interactions within the Taobao platform.  🚀🔍

The dataset includes all activities of approximately one million random users who were active between November 25, 2017, and December 3, 2017. The activities include clicking, purchasing, adding to cart, and liking. The organization of the dataset is similar to MovieLens-20M, where each row represents a user action consisting of User ID, Item ID, Category ID, Behavior Type, and Timestamp, separated by commas. Detailed descriptions of each column in the dataset are as follows:
